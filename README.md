# A HYBRID CRYPTOGRAPHY SYSTEM BASED ON THE VIGENERE CIPHER AND POLYBIUS SQUARE CIPHER
### This project aims to develop a secure and efficient hybrid cryptography system that combines the strengths of symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms. Cryptography is essential for ensuring data confidentiality and integrity, and our system takes it a step further by integrating two different encryption methods.
### By leveraging symmetric encryption for fast and efficient data encryption and decryption, and asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange, our system provides a balanced approach that enhances both security and performance. This allows users to protect their sensitive information while maintaining a user-friendly experience.
### The project focuses on developing a comprehensive user interface that simplifies the encryption and decryption process, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. Our goal is to provide a reliable and versatile solution that can be utilized in a wide range of applications where data security is paramount.
### Through this project, we aim to contribute to the field of cryptography by offering an innovative and practical approach that addresses the limitations of existing encryption systems and ensures the confidentiality of sensitive data in today's digital world.

### The working prototype user-interface when server is active and browser searched output is as below:
